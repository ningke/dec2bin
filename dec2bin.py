# Convert a decimal number (whole and fraction) to its binary representation.
#

##
# Algorithm:
# A decimal number is a number represented as multiples of 10s. So for example 53.72 is
# exponent of 10:        1    0   -1   -2
# multiples:            10    1   .1  .01
#                        5    3.   7    2
#
# Binary number is the same thing except it uses base 2: So a number 3.375:
# 3.375 = (2 + 1 + 1/8 + 1/4)
# exponent of 2:         1    0   -1   -2   -3
# multiples:             2    1  1/2  1/4  1/8
#                        1    1.   0    1    1
#
# So to convert a decimal number, we do it in two steps:
# 1) Convert left of decimal point (whole part):
#    We keep dividing it by 2 and record the remainder, this is equivalent to right
#    shifting on place and record the parity of bit 0.
#    So:
#      exponent              number        result    remainder   output
#             0               3 / 2    =        1           1         1
#             1               1 / 2    =        0           1        11
#
# 2) Convert right of decimal point (fraction part):
#    We keep multiply by 2 and record the overflow (the digit to the left of the decimal
#    point).
#    Remember that any rational number can be converted into a floating point
#    representation. But in some case the representation has repeats. So 1 / 3 is
#    0.33333333...... Similarly a binary number can be the same thing:
#    3 / 10 (0.3) is 0.1001 1001 1001 ......
#    Our algorithm needs to detect that we are converting the same number and note
#    that the digits are repeating and stop.
